This instance keeps the cover and trace of the [central holdout](#case/holdout), while changing the geometry on which its polynomial integration depends. The new terms are

\[
\frac1{14}\bigl(X_0^5\cdot X_1+2\cdot X_1^5\cdot X_2+X_2^5\cdot X_0\bigr),
\]

and the target remains \(A=X_0^3\cdot Y_0^3\). Writing the modified ternary sextic as \(f(X)\), the Fermat-curve cover still gives the weighted quotient

\[
H=f(X)+P\cdot(\alpha\cdot X_0^3\cdot X_1+\beta\cdot X_1^3\cdot X_2)+S^3-3\cdot S\cdot P^2,
\qquad \alpha^6+\beta^6=1.
\]

The interchange \(y\leftrightarrow T\), its density factor, and the nontrivial deck character used to recover the target all persist. The exact conic used for the central equation does not: substituting it in the added ternary terms gives a nonzero polynomial. Reusing its coefficient matrix or primitive without constructing a replacement family would leave a gap.

**Nonconstructive existence is known**, by the cover-and-trace support argument in [Chapter 4](#technical-information/known-locus), using the quotient-support principles of [Chapter 3](#technical-information/geometric-support). Over the generic point of the Fermat curve, \(H=0\) is a quasismooth degree-six hypersurface in \(\mathbb P(1,1,1,2,2)\), with anticanonical class \(\mathcal O(1)\). Quasismoothness can be checked at \((\alpha,\beta)=(1,0)\) and hence holds generically. Its three ambient quotient points have type \(\frac12(1,1,1)\). The resulting Fano threefolds are uniruled, and the cover's quotient fourfold has divisor-supported fourth cohomology. The same nontrivial deck character then isolates the prescribed class downstairs.

The challenge is to realize that support as an explicit rational-field certificate, or to formalize the geometric existence argument. A concrete starting point is the same finite-dimensional conic-incidence problem used for the central equation: find a conic with a nonsingular coefficient Jacobian, then prove that its algebraic family reaches the generic point. The asymmetric ternary perturbation removes the special parity blocks that simplified the original seed calculation.

Unlike [the moving-branch companion](#case/holdout-moving-branch), this equation does not force a new coefficient curve or a new trace projection. It isolates the question of how effectively the geometric family itself can be constructed. No denominator-degree bound or expanded witness is required by the formal challenge.
